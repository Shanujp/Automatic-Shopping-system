The objective of the product is to create an efficient , cost and time effective means to avoid long queues at shopping counters by implementing a smart shopping cart and hence by introducing a smart shopping system.
To overcome the limitations of the existing billing system we implement a RFID based Automatic Shopping System that uses a Node MCU microcontroller to control the transmission of data received by a RFID reader and display it wirelessly on the counter screen.
